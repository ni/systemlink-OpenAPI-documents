    properties:
      setPoints:
        description: Values which the tag's current value will be compared to when determining if the
          condition evaluates to true or not. Conditions associated with the IN_RANGE and OUT_OF_RANGE 
          comparators will have two set points. All other conditions should have only one set point.
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
        example: ["10"]
      comparator:
          type: string
          description: Operator which will be used when comparing the tag's current value to the set point(s).
            Note that the CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS comparators are only valid for rules associated with
            string tags. Similarly, LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, IN_RANGE, and the other numeric comparators are 
            not valid for rules associated with string tags.
          enum: [LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, IN_RANGE, OUT_OF_RANGE,
            EQUAL, NOT_EQUAL, CONTAINS, NOT_CONTAINS]  
      deadband:
        description: The change in signal from the set point necessary to clear an alarm. For example, a
          condition with a set point of 10, a comparator of GREATER_THAN, and a deadband of 2 will request 
          that alarms be cleared if the tag's values is less than or equal to (10 - 2) = 8. Similarly, if the
          condition had a comparator of LESS_THAN, the condition would request that alarms be cleared if the
          tag's value is greater than or equal to (10 + 2) = 12.
        type: string
        example: '2'
      severityLevel:
        description: An integer in the range [1,4] which specifies the severity level of a condition.
          Higher numeric values correspond to higher severity levels.
        type: integer
        minimum: 1

          on turbine <turbine_number>", and the rule was evaluated against a tag whose property dictionary
          contained the key "turbine_number" with value "5", then the rule would request that an alarm with 
          display name "Excessive vibration on turbine 5" be created.
        example: Excessive vibration on turbine <turbine_number>

              displayName:
                description: Display name query. Returns rules whose *displayName* fields contain the query
                  string, without taking case into account.
                type: string
                example: low disk space
              description:
                description: Description query. Returns rules whose *description* fields contain the query
                  string, without taking case into account.
                type: string
                example: turbine 5
              tagPath:
                description: Tag path query. If the query string contains wildcard characters, the service
                  will return rules whose *searchPaths* either intersect with, or are matched by, the query
                  string. For example, if the query string is CRIO1.System.Health.*, then the service would
                  return rules with search paths of CRIO1.System.Health.Foo and
                  *.System.Health.DiskUsePercentage. The former is matched by the query string, and the latter
                  intersects with the query string, as there exists a string which could be matched by both
                  expressions (such as CRIO1.System.Health.DiskUsePercentage). If the query string does not
                  contain wildcard characters, the service will return rules whose *searchPaths* match the
                  query string.
                type: string
